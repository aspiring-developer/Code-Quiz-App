# Code-Quiz-SS
THIS IS A CODE QUIZ QUESTION-ANSWER JAVASCRIPT PROJECT.
I started this project with very excitement because I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn more by doing this. 
As a new learner, I had to research a lot about codes and concepts tht I needed to put into it.
As we learned from the class that any coding project starts from pseudo codes; I did same way by pseudo coding and making rough graphics on a paper. 
I started coding; it was fine until I reached about half way. Then I stuck somewhere, so I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on! I learned so many small things that are necessary to be a good web developer in the future. "Coding takes time and practice!" Keeping this in mind, I did what I was able to do, and the result is here.
