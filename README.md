# Code-Quiz-SS
**It is a shortened version of the longer version codes that was posted earlier. 
As i learned a little more Javascript after submitting this assignment, I decided to rework on it for my coding practice.
This app is not fully functional yet, but I am glad that I did improve something by revisiting it. 

**App's functionality:
- This app loads as soon as the browser loads.
- The UI shows a start button to click and start the quiz.
- When a user clicks the start button, a 75 seconds timer runs in decreasing order.
- There are five questions. Every next question is accessed by next button.
- The user should be able to view score on the bottom portion of the app.
- When the timer reaches to 0 seconds, the quiz is over - resets the quiz.
