# Code-Quiz-SS
THIS IS A CODE QUIZ QUESTION-ANSWER JAVASCRIPT PROJECT.
- First of all, I designed the UI layout without using Javascript to see what I needed.
- I used css flex property and several rules to layout the design, which helped me visualize the final look.
- Then taking the layout as a reference, I worked on Javascript to create HTML elements and style them. 
- I then started further coding to make the app working. The code worked as intended, but the code was over 400 lines!!!! I wasn't happy what I did, and didn't have experience how to shorten the codes. Loops, functions, arrays, objects could be helpful, but did not have enough confident in me to work with them. So, I got help from tutor. The tutor showed me how could be done, then I did that way. I learned so many things about the Javascript by doing this homework. I am happy with the final result.
